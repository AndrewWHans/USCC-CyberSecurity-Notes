# CTF Spotlight concepts

**Reverse engineering**(RE): involve taking a binary and reverse engineering it to determine its functionality (finding a flag)
> process of dissecting and comprehending the internal mechanisms, architecture, and operation of hardware, software, or systems to expose their design concepts, source code, or architecture. Also used for vulnerability research<br>
> Example: A reverse engineer will take the final product and pull it apart to figure out what parts were used to make the final product.
> This process is usually used in malware analysis, like an autopsy or **autopsia** "To see for one's self"

**packing**: malware is compressed & disassembly won't work.
