# OSINT(Open-Source Intelligence)

## What is OSINT?

OSINT: defined as intelligence produced by <br>1) collecting, <br>2) evaluating, <br>3) analyzing publicly available info with the purpose of answering a specific intelligence Q.

## Information vs Intelligence <br>

info != intelligence. Without giving a *meaning* to the data we collect, the open-source findings are considered to be "raw data"

Many people use OSINT, such as social engineers, private investigators, government, military, and more. <br>
Along with open source intelligence, there is the **intelligence cycle**, which describes the following stages in order:<br>1) Preparation, <br>2) Collection, <br>3) Processing, <br>4) Analysis and Production, <br>5) Dissemination

## OSINT tactics

**Active vs Passive**:<br>
Active involves having **some** contact with target, meanwhile Passive **avoids any contact** with the target.
Active always involves some small risk of target detecting you're investigating them,<br>
Passive involves querying a DB maintained by somebody else, usually not having any risk of being detected.

## Relation to others (SOCMINT/HUMINT)

HUMINT(Human Intelligence): old way of how intelligence collection is done using human sources to collect information.


## Risks and Resources

There are plenty of risks, such as making contact with the subject/third party who can sell your search to the third party directly.<br>
An example from What is OSINT:<br>
> With LinkedIn, you may find a link to a subject’s LinkedIn profile and forget to sign out of your own, prompting LinkedIn to offer the target the information that you were looking at their profile as part of their product.

> This kind of contact can blow an investigation, as can accessing a web resource belonging to a target from your organization’s IP address. If you work for an organization that does not want to be identified while investigating a target, you must always use a VPN to hide the IP address of the place that you’re working from, or risk making your attention to any particular part of the target’s infrastructure obvious.
