## What is OSINT?

OSINT: defined as intelligence produced by <br>1) collecting, <br>2) evaluating, <br>3) analyzing publicly available info with the purpose of answering a specific intelligence Q.

## Information vs Intelligence <br>

info != intelligence. Without giving a *meaning* to the data we collect, the open-source findings are considered to be "raw data"

Many people use OSINT, such as social engineers, private investigators, government, military, and more. <br>
Along with open source intelligence, there is the **intelligence cycle**, which describes the following stages in order:<br>1) Preparation, <br>2) Collection, <br>3) Processing, <br>4) Analysis and Production, <br>5) Dissemination
