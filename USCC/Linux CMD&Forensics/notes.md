# Linux Command Line for Analysts & Operators

Unix design philosophy **"Write simple tools, chain them together with pipelines to make more complex tools"**. Order is determined by the recipe you need to use to convert the data from initial form to what final output to be. 

commands:<br>
sudo - admin access on limited basis <br>
ALL - ex: ALL=(ALL:ALL), for all systems, for all users, in all commands
Set-UID: run as executable owner, not user
Set-GID: group privs of executable, not user
ls sudoers.d = attacker gateway for root access
-u - used to state the website being scanned
-w - takes a list of words to iterate through to find hidden pages
