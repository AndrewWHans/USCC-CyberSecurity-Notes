# Penetration testing and the usage of this technique

Aka pen testing, is the act of assessing a computer system, network, or organization for security vulnerabilities.
Pen tests usually seek to breach a system, people, processes/code to uncover vulnerabilities that can be exploited.
Info is then used to improve system defenses ensuring it is better able to withstand cyber attacks in the near future.

## 5 step process 
1) Planning (gather info about target/network, potential vulnerabilities, and exploits to use against it)
2) Scanning (active reconnaissance to probe target sys/network and identify potential weakness)
3) Gaining Access (sniff network traffic and gain access to target sys)
4) Maintaining Access (hide presence)
5) Analysis and reporting (report to improve organization security)
