# How do we analyze a program?

Two approaches:
1) Static

2) Dynamic

# Concepts

We look for bugs (revolving memory corruption, rounding errors, null pointers, inf loop, etc)

# The SAT Problem

Lets say we are given a problem or formula that contains binary variables connected to logical relations like *OR* or *AND*.
The aim is to establish if there is any way to set the variables for that
